# Updates


<v-click>

###### New Project: &ldquo;Meta-Learning for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning&rdquo;

* Challenge: adapt efficiently to tasks with varying dynamics.
* Goal: deploy on a real robotic system.
* In collaboration with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=EfLpX8QAAAAJ&hl=en">Jonas Rothfuss</a>, <a href="https://las.inf.ethz.ch/people/bhavya-sukhija">Bhavya Sukhija</a>, and Arjun Bhardwaj.
* Extension: apply to safety-critical tasks.

# Case Study
Mazor Robotics SpineAssist [^1]

<v-clicks>

- Take preoperative CT images.
- At the beginning of the procedure: two fluoroscopy (x-ray) images are taken: Anterior-Posterior (front-to-back) and oblique (45 degrees).
- The flouroscopy images are then registered against the preoperative CT images.
- This allows "open-loop" navigation---planning is done preoperatively manually by the surgeon.
- The intraoperative execution is <em>in the physician's hands</em>.

# Questions

<v-clicks>

- Do we have a specific system that we want to build upon?
- What would be a realistic observation space? Intraoperative fluoroscopy + preoperative CT?
- What would be a realistic action space? Joint positions? End-effector position & orientation?
- Helping the surgeon follow the preoperative plan? Online planning? Only offline (manual) planning?
